# Mapping-Synthesis
Synthesizing Mapping Relationships Using Table Corpus

### Overview
This is the benchmark data set used in our experiments described [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/mapping-synthesis.pdf). 

The data set contains 80 mapping relationships manually labelled from web data and used as benchmark cases. 

### Data set description
There is one big file containing all ground truth mapping relationships. Each row has 3 columns:

* The first column has the name of the mapping relationship
* The second column has a cell value on the left-hand-side of the mapping
* The third column has a cell value on the right-hand-side of the mapping
